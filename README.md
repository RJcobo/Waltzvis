This is a very rough and very un-intuitive program, built off hopes and dreams.
The only way i was able to get it to work is in vscode in a virtual environment.
It should load right once you put them all in a folder called waltzvizpython
Then you should create the virtual environment with the command line
use pip to install the libraries from requirments.txt
then use python gui.py to load into the program, then visualize to start the audio visualizer.
